Roughly 1982, a slot-load vinyl player was patented and made in Italy. Red top, white base, the LUCSON MKI offered me countless hours of entertainment when I was a child in the late '80s.
It definitely shaped who I am as I was listening to any sorts of '70s disco music, '80s synth-pop and children fairy tales, all rigorously sold on 45rpm vinyls at the time.

When I tried to put it back into shape, roughly 40 years later, I started looking for online references, but found almost absolutely nothing, surely no pictures nor documentation.
Hence this page to document and preserve its legacy.

# Overview
![Top view of LUCSON MKI](/images/top_view.jpg)

The LUCSON MKI has only one sticker: golden background, black font, all uppercase "LUCSON MKI". No other stickers nor mentions of a brand name, address or other references.

On the bottom, embossed in the plastic we find one English sentence: "Made in Italy", while the other few words are all in Italian. "Brevettato", which stands for *Patented* and,
next to the battery compartment, we find "6 BATTERIE DA 1.5 VOLTS", which stands for *6 1.5 Volt batteries*.
